# Blockless Sites

Blockless Sites is the easiest way for you to build, deploy, and serve decentralized front-end applications.

Builidng on the decentralized foundation of [Blockless Protocol](../protocol/) and the dynamic capabilities of [Blockless Functions](../functions), Blockless Sites is easiest and fastest way for you to host and serve static assets, while providing the ability to execute decentralized serverless functions for dynamic content.

## Key Features

### Multi-Framework Support

Blockless Sites supports a wide range of front-end frameworks such as Next.js, React, Sevlte, Vue, Astro, and Gatsby. For the majorities of supported frameworks, you can directly build and deploy them without any upfront configurations.

### Decentralized Content Hosting

Blockless Sites automatically deploys the build artifact to IPFS, ensuring your site artifact is securely stored. The retrieval and serving of your site to user clients (browsers) are managed through Blockless Functions under the hood, facilitating a seamless and efficient delivery of content.

### Decentralized Edge CDN

Leveraging Blockless' extensive node network, your build artifacts are cached on edge devices located in close proximity to your end users. This feature ensures fast and reliable content delivery, improving the overall user experience of your decentralized applications.

### Dynamic Functions (Coming Soon)

With dynamic functions support, you will be able to utilize serverless functions to manage dynamic content in your decentralized applications, including server-side rending or on-chain interactions, creating a more engaging and interactive user experience.
