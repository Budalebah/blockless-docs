# Initial Node Offering

Initial Node Offering (INO) is an innovative mechanism that allows projects to launch and recruit dedicated nodes on the Blockless Network, while directly distributing their project tokens to infrastructure contributors. This approach fosters a mutually beneficial relationship between projects and their supporters, encouraging long-term commitment and engagement from both parties.

Through INOs, projects can easily set up, manage, and scale their infrastructure on the Blockless Network without building the infrastructure from the ground up. This model encourages the growth and adoption of new projects, while also ensuring that the Blockless Network continually expands its user base and range of services.
